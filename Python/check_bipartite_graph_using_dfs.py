# Check whether Graph is Bipartite or Not using DFS


# A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets,
# U and V such that every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex
# from V to U. In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V,
# or u belongs to V and v to U. We can also say that there is no edge that connects
# vertices of same set.
