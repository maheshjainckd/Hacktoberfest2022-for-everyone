# basic-php-sql-form-site
I created a simple form website to know about how to collect data from a form and store that on database. It is a dynamic website and stores data on MySQL database.
This project was not intended for good design..Please ignore the design if you do not find it good. I will improve on design as it is a beginner level project.
This project is deployed here: https://gndec-form.000webhostapp.com/
